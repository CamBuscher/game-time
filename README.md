## Breakout (or brickbreaker)

Our first foray into object-oriented programming! Krista Handel and I made brickbreaker while leveraging ES6 classes and the HTML canvas element. We have three levels, flawless* collision detection, and localStorage high scores. 

The structuring of files was new for us, as was the use of ES6, webpack and testing in our project. Those challenges were actually kind of fun, and I am excited for using test-driven development in projects to come.
